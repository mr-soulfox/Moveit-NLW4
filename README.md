### Move-it

   Move-it was an application created at NLW4 (Next Level Week), a Roketseat event in February 2021, on the React track where its main idea was to be a Pomodoro with stretching exercises for eyes and body after 25 minutes. In this event we built the main system (Counter, Cycles, Counter, Challenges, Level and Share with twitter), there were 12 exercises (three for the eyes and nine for the body).
